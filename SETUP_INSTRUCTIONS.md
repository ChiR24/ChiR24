2. Push this README.md file and the assets folder to that repository
3. Make sure the repository is public
4. GitHub will automatically recognize and display the README.md content on your profile page

## Steps for Adding the Spaceship Animation:

2. Add it to the assets folder
3. Push the changes to GitHub
4. The README references the animation using this path:
