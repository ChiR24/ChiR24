# Setting Up Your GitHub Profile

To make this README appear on your GitHub profile, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub with the **exact same name as your GitHub username** (in this case, `ChiR24`)
2. Push this README.md file to that repository
3. Make sure the repository is public
4. GitHub will automatically recognize and display the README.md content on your profile page

## About the 3D Animation

The README now uses a reliable GitHub contribution snake animation:
```html
<div align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/ChiR24">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Platane/snk/output/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg" alt="3D GitHub Animation">
  </a>
</div>
```

This animation is directly hosted on GitHub, ensuring it will always display properly.

## Benefits of Using GitHub-Hosted SVG Animations:
- 100% reliable display on GitHub profiles
- No dependency on external hosting services
- Consistent appearance across all devices
- Better integration with GitHub's design

## Alternative: Using Self-Hosted GIFs

If you prefer to host your own animation:
1. Create an 'assets' folder in your repository
2. Add your GIF file to that folder
3. Update the image path to: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChiR24/ChiR24/main/assets/your-file-name.gif`

## Customizing Your Profile:

Feel free to modify the README.md to:
- Update your personal description
- Add or remove technology badges
- Include links to your projects
- Add social media links
- Customize the color themes of widgets
